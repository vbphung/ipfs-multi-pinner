# (DEPRECATED) IPFS client supporting multiple Pinning services

This is the last update for this library due to an issue happening at [manager/action.go:42](https://github.com/vbphung/easipfs/blob/ec3a13faa53152f0bea82b70b65201ad84ec9fa6/manager/action.go#L42) that blocks the publishing action result process indefinitely.
